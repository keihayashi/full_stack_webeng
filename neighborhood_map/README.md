Neighborhood Map

## Description
This application shows fancy chocolate shops around SF. You can click and see tips from people visited there, which I get using Foursquare API.

## Usage
1. Clone or download this directory.
2. Get your **client_id** and **client_secret** by creating an app at [Foursquare developer page](https://developer.foursquare.com/), and replace the fields of script.js file.
3. Open the index.html file in browser. You can do filter search and see tips by clicking markers or list items.
